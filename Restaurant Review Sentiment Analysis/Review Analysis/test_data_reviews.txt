Loved this place.
Crust is not good.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
The fries were great too.
A great touch.
Service was very prompt.
Would not go back.
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
Highly recommended.
Waitress was a little slow in service.
did not like at all.
"The food, amazing."
Service is also cute.
They never brought a salad we asked for.
